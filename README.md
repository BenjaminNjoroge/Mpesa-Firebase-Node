Mpesa STKPUSH for WooCommerce is a payment gateway integration that allows 
customers to make payments using Mpesa mobile money on a WooCommerce website. 
This integration works on both Android and IOS platforms.
STKPUSH stands for "Sim Toolkit Push". It is a feature provided by Safaricom, the 
company behind Mpesa, which allows payment requests to be sent directly to a
customer's phone through the SIM card. This means that customers do not have to 
enter their phone numbers or any other details during the payment process.
With the Mpesa STKPUSH for WooCommerce integration, customers can simply select 
Mpesa as their payment method during checkout, and a payment request will be sent to 
their phone via STKPUSH. They will then receive a prompt on their phone to confirm the 
payment, and once confirmed, the payment will be processed and the order will be 
marked as paid on the WooCommerce website.
The Mpesa STKPUSH for WooCommerce integration provides a seamless and secure 
payment experience for customers, and helps to reduce payment delays and errors. It 
also provides merchants with a reliable and efficient payment solution, helping to 
increase sales and customer satisfaction
